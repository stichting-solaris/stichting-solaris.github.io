                    His research focuses on developing new acquisition and signal processing methods for 
                    functional neuroimaging that allow the tracking and visualisation of distributed brain

                    and applying this in clinical practice. Stephan is passionate about making research and 
                    scientific practice more transparent, rigorous and inclusive. 
                    He started the <a href="https://osceindhoven.github.io/"><font color="000000">

                       of Alzheimer’s disease, and the impact of therapeutics on these two components. 
                       Dr. Badhwar is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Centre de recherche de

                <p align="justify">Dr Ali Khatibi holds a PhD degree in psychology obtained in 2014 from KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. 
                      He started his academic journey by studying Biology at the University of Guilan, 
                      Iran, and then he moved to Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran to study Psychology. 
                      After his PhD, he moved to Montreal and was a postdoc at the University of Montreal 
                      and McGill University (2014-2015; 2017-2019). 
                      He is currently a Senior Research Fellow in Pain and neuroplasticity at the 
                      Centre of Precision Rehabilitation for Spinal Pain at the School of Sport, Exercise and 
                      Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Birmingham. 
                      His research interest is the study of chronic diseases and cognitive bias in patients, 
                      and he has expertise in simultaneous functional imaging of the brain and the spinal cord in human.</p>
                <p align="justify">Ali likes to contribute to the improvement of the quality of life in trainees and 
                       early career researchers. He also tries to increase awareness about bullying at work 
                       and in academic environments (like against those decided to leave academia) and wishes 
                       to see more diversity and real equality in academia.
